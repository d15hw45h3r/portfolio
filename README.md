This is my portfolio

I am constantly changing it. My design changes, so as the things I put in there. You never know when I will stop remaking it. :)

I would make it more compact, more practical and with reusable components, if I could afford a host. 
But I can`t. So I need to show my skills as much as I can with those resources.
